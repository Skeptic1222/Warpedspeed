# Warped Speed: A Science Fiction Text Adventure Engine

## Project Vision

Warped Speed is a cutting-edge, database-driven science fiction text adventure engine powered by multiple AI agents working in concert. The system provides a rich, dynamic narrative experience that adapts to player choices while maintaining a consistent universe.

## Core Principles

1. **Database-Driven Architecture**: All content, prompts, UI elements, and game state are stored in and retrieved from a robust database system.

2. **Multi-Agent System**: The game utilizes multiple simulated AI agents, each with specialized roles, working together to create a complex, reactive narrative.

3. **Dynamic Content Generation**: Text, actions, and images are procedurally generated based on player choices and game state.

4. **Modular Design**: Components are decoupled for easy maintenance, testing, and expansion.

5. **Responsive UI**: Mobile-first interface design that works across devices while maintaining immersion.

6. **Genre Adaptability**: Although starting with science fiction, the system is designed to be adapted to other genres through database modifications.

## Phase Approach

This project follows a phased development approach:

- **Phase 1**: Core text-based gameplay without images
- **Phase 2**: Image integration and advanced UI elements
- **Phase 3**: Full expansion of features and cross-platform optimization

## Project Status

Currently implementing Phase 0: Project reset and architecture design.

## Repository Structure

- `.cursor/`: Project metadata and rules
- `docs/`: Comprehensive documentation of all systems
- `src/`: Source code (frontend and backend)
- `db/`: Database schema and seed data
- `assets/`: Media resources (empty until Phase 2)

## Getting Started

Refer to the documentation in `docs/` for complete details on architecture, systems, and implementation plans.

Phase 1 will be the first functional implementation focusing on text-based gameplay with database integration.
