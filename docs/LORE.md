# Warped Speed - Universe Lore

This document outlines the core lore and world-building for the Warped Speed universe. All lore is stored in the database and can be swapped out for different genres or settings.

## The Warped Speed Universe

### Setting Overview

The year is 2387, two centuries after humanity's expansion beyond the solar system. Faster-than-light travel, known as "warping," has connected a network of colonies, stations, and outposts across hundreds of star systems in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way. This era of expansion brought humanity into contact with three sentient alien species, leading to diplomatic relations, cultural exchange, and occasional conflicts.

The player navigates this complex interstellar society as a spacer - someone who makes their living traveling between worlds. Whether as a trader, explorer, mercenary, or diplomat, the player's journey takes them across diverse planets, stations, and vessels, encountering the wonders and dangers of this future.

## Major Factions

### Terran Confederation
**Headquarters**: Earth (Sol System)
**Government**: Federal representative democracy
**Description**: The primary human government, formed after the unification of Earth nations during the early colonial period. Maintains the largest navy and controls most human colonies. Bureaucratic but generally stable, with occasional corruption and political intrigue.

### Independent Frontier Alliance
**Headquarters**: Nova Liberty (Tau Ceti System)
**Government**: Loose confederacy of independent worlds
**Description**: A coalition of outer colonies that declared independence from the Confederation fifty years ago. Values autonomy and free trade, but struggles with security and infrastructure. Home to entrepreneurs, pioneers, and occasionally outlaws.

### Andron Sovereignty
**Headquarters**: Vesh'ka (Epsilon Eridani System)
**Government**: Meritocratic technocracy
**Description**: The most technologically advanced alien civilization encountered by humanity. The Androns value intellect, precision, and efficiency. Their society is structured around aptitude tests and specialized career paths, with AI augmentation common in their daily lives.

## Technology

### Warp Travel
FTL travel works by temporarily shifting a vessel into a parallel dimension (warpspace) where the laws of physics allow effective superluminal travel. Ships require specialized warp drives that create and maintain a stable "bubble" around the vessel. Travel between nearby stars takes days, while crossing the entire human-settled region might take months.

### Quantum Communications
Instant communication across interstellar distances using quantum entanglement. Limited bandwidth means text and audio are common, while video and holographic communication require more expensive equipment. Most settled systems have QComm relays, but frontier regions may be out of regular contact.

### Neural Interfaces
Direct brain-computer interfaces allowing mental control of devices and systems. Common in high-tech areas but require implants or external headsets. The Androns have the most advanced neural technology, often integrating it extensively into their bodies.

### Artificial Intelligence
True general AI exists but is heavily regulated after the "Cognition Conflicts" of the 2260s. Most civilian systems use limited AI with specific constraints. Military and research installations may have more advanced systems under strict oversight.

### Energy Systems
Fusion power is standard for large installations and ships. Antimatter exists but is extremely expensive and primarily used for military applications. Renewable energy is common on established colonies, with various systems adapted to local conditions.

### Weapons Technology
Energy weapons (lasers, plasma) are common for ship-to-ship combat and heavy infantry weapons. Projectile weapons still exist for personal defense, using advanced materials and power assistance. Kinetic weapons (railguns, mass drivers) are used for capital ships.

## Key Locations

### Sol System
Humanity's birth system. Earth remains the political center of human space, though much of its population has moved to orbital habitats and colonies. Mars is fully terraformed, while Venus has cloud cities. The asteroid belt and Jupiter's moons host major mining and industrial operations.

### Core Worlds
The most developed and populous human colonies, including:
- Alpha Centauri: Humanity's first extrasolar colony, now a major cultural center
- Tau Ceti: Commercial hub and headquarters of the Independent Frontier Alliance
